# ANONYMOUS
1.What is Anonymous?
Anonymus means anonymous or hidden persons. Anonymous was born from crime and computer scientists... Anonymous has no leader, but only accepts if the majority agrees. Regardless of whether it bothers them... Each of us on the planet has different thinking and intellectual conflicts. You can't get intelligence from yourself, but when others think you're smart. IQ is a measure of knowledge... Everything is a struggle, but not everything is achieved through strugyle... We are the creators of our destinies, but that is taken away over time.
2.MY OPINION ANONYMOUS
We are legion. We are a sect. We are hackers. We are the leaders. We are souls. We are everything you want.
